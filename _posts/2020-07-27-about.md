title: About this blog
---

Thanks for visiting my webblog. My name is Bas Smeets. This blog is about software development and other things that keep me busy.
At the moment my main interests are webdevelopment and microservices architecture. Im trying to learn more about Docker, Kubernetes and automation in general.
Talking about automation, one of my interests is homeautomation. Currently im running a setup of Raspi3 + ssd running HomeAssistant, im using this to automate the light and monitor the temperature in my house.
In this blog i will share my learnings and take you on my journey.
