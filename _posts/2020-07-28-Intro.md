title: Setting up this blog
---
This blog is setup using Jekyll a tool developed by github.
To be honest is saw a blog in this format with another person and i wanted to make something that looked as cool.
I didnt really have an idea what to blog about, neither am i a very outgoing person. 
So i decided to do it more for myself and to have a nice way of looking up personal learnings.
I am kinda of datahoarder so that makes perfect sense.

Below i will explain how i have created this blog:
First its a good idea to read the documentation on jekyll on this website - https://jekyllrb.com/. This way you will get a feeling for what Jekyll is and how it can help you to setup a static website.
Having a static website is quite easy to maintain as you dont need to have a database to store your assets etc. You will simply write all your blogpost directly into the sourcecode.

Jekyll is written in ruby and can be installed with gem. Gem is a package manager we for ruby.
If you dont have gem and ruby installed please check this link - {https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/}
Next we need to install Jekyll and bundler which is used for building the website.

`gem install jekyll bundler`

Next i downloaded the entire repo from https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.
This is a nice theme and has a directory structure pre-setup for you. 
If you are not interested in this particular them then head over to https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/ to find a theme suited to your liking.
